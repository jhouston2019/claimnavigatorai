                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Vandalism claims involve intentional damage to property—broken windows, graffiti, forced entry, or destruction of contents. Prompt police reporting is typically required by policy; obtain the report number and officer contact. Coverage may vary if the property is vacant or under construction, so confirm policy conditions and any special endorsements.</p>
                <p>Document forced entry indicators (pry marks, broken locks, damaged frames) and the path of damage inside. Capture serial numbers and photos for damaged contents. Mitigation—board-up and securing the premises—should occur immediately to prevent further loss.</p>
                <p>Distinguish vandalism from theft; some policies treat them differently, and sublimits may apply. If business personal property is impacted, inventory losses with purchase details. For buildings, provide contractor estimates to restore damaged components.</p>
                <p>Insurers may question causation if access was unsecured or the property was vacant beyond a stated period. Provide evidence of occupancy, alarm usage, and security steps to support coverage.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>File a police report promptly; keep the report number and date.</li>
                    <li>Show signs of forced entry or intentional damage to establish peril.</li>
                    <li>Mitigate immediately: board-up, change locks, and secure openings.</li>
                    <li>Check vacancy clauses and endorsements that may limit vandalism coverage.</li>
                    <li>Inventory building and contents damage separately with valuations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Notify law enforcement and obtain a report number; share it with the carrier.</li>
                    <li>Photograph exterior and interior damage, focusing on forced entry points.</li>
                    <li>Secure the property and prevent further loss through board-up or lock replacement.</li>
                    <li>Compile contents and structural estimates; include receipts or pricing sources.</li>
                    <li>Submit claim documentation and respond promptly to any requests for additional detail.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Police report and incident number.</li>
                    <li>Photos of forced entry, damaged property, and serial numbers where available.</li>
                    <li>Contractor estimates for repairs and board-up invoices.</li>
                    <li>Contents inventory with values and proof of ownership where possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Questioning forced entry to suggest non-covered causes.</li>
                    <li>Applying vacancy exclusions or conditions to limit payment.</li>
                    <li>Reducing valuations due to alleged pre-existing damage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carrier hesitation to accept the police report or requests to delay board-up.</li>
                    <li>Assumptions that missing items were stolen rather than vandalized without investigation.</li>
                    <li>Denials citing vacancy without verifying occupancy facts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep security system records or occupancy proof to counter vacancy arguments.</li>
                    <li>Provide organized inventories and repair scopes with photos to speed evaluation.</li>
                    <li>Maintain professional communication and request written explanations for any adverse decision.</li>
                </ul>
