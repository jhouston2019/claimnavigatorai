                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Property damage claims hinge on accurate scope, valuation, and clear separation of dwelling (Coverage A) versus other structures (Coverage B) and contents (Coverage C). Policies may pay on Actual Cash Value (ACV) initially, with Replacement Cost Value (RCV) recoverable after repair or replacement. Depreciation schedules and holdbacks must be documented and released once proof of completion is provided.</p>
                <p>Structural components require detailed line-item estimates for framing, roofing, mechanicals, and finishes. Contents losses need inventories with age, condition, and price substantiation. Ordinance or Law coverage may apply when building codes require upgrades; document code citations to support coverage.</p>
                <p>Insurers expect mitigation to prevent further damage. Keep receipts for tarping, drying, and temporary repairs. If the insurer delays, note that additional damage caused by delay should not be held against the insured.</p>
                <p>Transparency and organized documentation shorten adjustment time. Provide clear photos, contractor estimates, and invoices. Request the carrier’s estimate and reconcile line by line to resolve variances.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distinguish dwelling, other structures, and contents; apply the correct coverage and sublimits.</li>
                    <li>Understand ACV vs. RCV: initial ACV payment, RCV holdback released upon proof of repair.</li>
                    <li>Depreciation must be reasonable and tied to condition, age, and useful life.</li>
                    <li>Ordinance or Law may cover code-required upgrades; provide code citations and inspector notes.</li>
                    <li>Mitigation is required; keep receipts and document conditions before and after temporary repairs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Document damage with dated photos/videos, focusing on structural and contents impacts.</li>
                    <li>Obtain detailed contractor estimates and, if possible, an independent scope for comparison.</li>
                    <li>Request the carrier’s estimate; compare line items, unit costs, and depreciation.</li>
                    <li>Submit contents inventory with descriptions, age, condition, and pricing support.</li>
                    <li>After repairs, submit invoices and proof of completion to release RCV holdback.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Photos and videos of all affected areas and materials.</li>
                    <li>Contractor estimates and any engineering or specialty reports.</li>
                    <li>Contents inventory with receipts or market pricing sources.</li>
                    <li>Invoices and proof of completion to claim RCV holdback.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Applying excessive depreciation to reduce ACV payments.</li>
                    <li>Using generic pricing databases without accounting for local costs.</li>
                    <li>Omitting code upgrades or specialty trades from the scope.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Significant gaps between insurer and contractor scopes with little explanation.</li>
                    <li>Denials of code items without reviewing local requirements.</li>
                    <li>Delays releasing holdback after proof of completion is provided.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Request and review the carrier estimate early; reconcile differences promptly.</li>
                    <li>Keep meticulous receipts and before/after documentation for all mitigation and repairs.</li>
                    <li>Submit supplemental requests with clear line references and supporting evidence.</li>
                </ul>
