                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Theft claims require proof of loss, ownership, and forced entry or unlawful taking. Policies often exclude mysterious disappearance and may have sublimits for jewelry, electronics, firearms, and cash. Prompt police reporting is essential; obtain the report number and list stolen items with detail.</p>
                <p>Forced entry evidence—broken locks, windows, pry marks—supports the claim. For contents, provide receipts, photos, serial numbers, and statements of age/condition. If records are missing, use bank statements or affidavits where allowed. Secure the property immediately to prevent further loss.</p>
                <p>Vacancy or construction status can affect coverage. Demonstrate occupancy and security measures (alarms, cameras) when applicable. Coordinate with the carrier on inspections and provide any third-party data (alarm logs, video) if available.</p>
                <p>Business theft claims should separate stock vs. equipment, account for cost of goods sold, and consider business interruption if operations are impacted.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>File a police report promptly and provide the case number to the insurer.</li>
                    <li>Show evidence of theft or forced entry; mysterious disappearance is typically excluded.</li>
                    <li>Observe sublimits for categories like jewelry, electronics, firearms, and cash.</li>
                    <li>Provide proof of ownership and value through receipts, photos, or bank records.</li>
                    <li>Secure the property post-loss and document mitigation steps.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Report the theft to law enforcement; obtain the incident number and officer contact.</li>
                    <li>Photograph entry points and any damage; preserve videos or alarm records.</li>
                    <li>Create a detailed stolen-items list with values, age, and proof of ownership.</li>
                    <li>Notify the carrier, provide the police report number, and schedule inspection if needed.</li>
                    <li>Respond quickly to requests for documentation and update the list if items are recovered.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Police report and incident number.</li>
                    <li>Photos of forced entry and any available video or alarm logs.</li>
                    <li>Itemized inventory with receipts, serial numbers, or other proof of ownership.</li>
                    <li>Invoices for temporary repairs or security measures.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Asserting mysterious disappearance to avoid coverage.</li>
                    <li>Applying sublimits aggressively without verifying item categories.</li>
                    <li>Demanding proof beyond reasonable documentation for everyday items.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delays citing “investigation” without clear requests.</li>
                    <li>Pressure to settle before verifying sublimit application or item classification.</li>
                    <li>Rejections of reasonable proof of ownership without alternatives offered.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organize inventories by category and flag items subject to sublimits.</li>
                    <li>Provide multiple proof types when receipts are missing (photos, bank statements, warranties).</li>
                    <li>Keep communication timely and request written explanations for any reductions or denials.</li>
                </ul>
