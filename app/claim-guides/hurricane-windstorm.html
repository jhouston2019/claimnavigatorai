                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Hurricane and windstorm claims often involve multiple perils: wind, wind-driven rain, and potential flood. Anti-concurrent causation clauses and separate hurricane/wind deductibles can dramatically impact recovery. Distinguishing wind damage (covered) from flood (often excluded or separately insured) is critical; roof uplift indicators, creased shingles, and wind-created openings support wind causation.</p>
                <p>Post-storm inspections should document elevations, debris lines, and interior patterns of intrusion. Storm-created openings (shingle loss, flashing failure, impact damage) can establish coverage for ensuing rain. Moisture mapping helps separate wind-driven water from ground-up flood.</p>
                <p>Business interruption and additional living expense claims should tie displacement or revenue loss to covered wind damage. Civil authority and ingress/egress coverage may apply when orders restrict access.</p>
                <p>Catastrophe environments bring surge staffing; request adjuster continuity and written scopes. Keep independent contractor estimates and engineer evaluations where structural uplift or envelope failure is suspected.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify and document wind-created openings; connect interior damage to those points.</li>
                    <li>Differentiate wind vs. flood; note waterlines, debris patterns, and entry points.</li>
                    <li>Review anti-concurrent causation clauses and hurricane/wind deductibles carefully.</li>
                    <li>Ordinance or Law may apply for roof decking, strapping, and code upgrades.</li>
                    <li>Maintain ALE/BI logs tied to covered wind damage and access restrictions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Photograph exterior and roof conditions early; capture missing shingles, lifted seams, and impact points.</li>
                    <li>Document interior moisture paths and elevations; use moisture readings to map spread.</li>
                    <li>Request carrier inspection; if disputed, consider independent roofing/engineering assessments.</li>
                    <li>Prepare a detailed repair scope including roof, exterior cladding, windows, and interior finishes.</li>
                    <li>Track ALE/BI impacts with receipts and financial records; submit periodically for reimbursement.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roof and exterior photos showing uplift, creases, and openings.</li>
                    <li>Moisture maps, interior damage photos, and mitigation invoices.</li>
                    <li>Contractor or engineer reports supporting wind causation.</li>
                    <li>ALE/BI expense logs, revenue records, and supporting invoices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attributing interior water to flood or pre-existing leaks despite wind indicators.</li>
                    <li>Applying high hurricane deductibles even when events do not trigger them.</li>
                    <li>Limiting roof repairs to spot fixes where full replacement is warranted by uplift or brittle failure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Denials without on-roof inspection or without testing for brittle shingles.</li>
                    <li>Ignoring window/door failures or wind-driven rain paths when scopes are written.</li>
                    <li>Payment offers that exclude ordinance/code-required upgrades.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Capture thorough roof documentation before emergency tarping when safe.</li>
                    <li>Keep separate files for wind vs. flood evidence; clarify coverage triggers.</li>
                    <li>Request written deductible application explanation and coverage position tied to facts.</li>
                </ul>
