                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Water damage claims turn on cause (sudden and accidental vs. repeated seepage), category (clean, gray, black), and documentation of mitigation. Policies often exclude long-term leakage and limit mold coverage. Prompt drying, moisture mapping, and photo logs are essential to prove reasonableness and prevent secondary damage.</p>
                <p>Distinguish between resulting damage (covered) and faulty work or wear-and-tear (often excluded). Sudden pipe bursts are typically covered; slow leaks may be denied. Insurers expect mitigation actions such as shutoff, extraction, dehumidification, and removal of saturated materials when necessary.</p>
                <p>Mold limitations usually cap coverage and require rapid response. Maintain drying logs, equipment readings, and contractor invoices. If hidden damage is discovered, notify the carrier immediately and request reinspection.</p>
                <p>Contents and structural claims should be separated, with detailed inventories and scope notes. Waterline staining, delamination, and microbial growth risk should be documented with dates to show progression.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coverage depends on sudden and accidental cause; long-term leakage is often excluded.</li>
                    <li>Mitigation must begin promptly—document actions and readings.</li>
                    <li>Mold sublimits may apply; note caps and required approvals for remediation.</li>
                    <li>Hidden damage discoveries should be reported immediately to adjust the scope.</li>
                    <li>Separate dwelling and contents claims with clear inventories and valuations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Stop the source and photograph conditions before mitigation begins.</li>
                    <li>Engage mitigation contractors; keep moisture maps, daily readings, and equipment logs.</li>
                    <li>Notify the carrier, request inspection, and share initial findings.</li>
                    <li>Develop a repair scope once materials are dry; include flooring, drywall, cabinetry, and finishes.</li>
                    <li>Submit supplements for hidden damage discovered during tear-out with dated photos.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cause-of-loss description with photos and video.</li>
                    <li>Drying logs, moisture readings, and mitigation invoices.</li>
                    <li>Repair estimates and material specifications.</li>
                    <li>Contents inventory with values and proof of ownership where available.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Labeling the loss as “long-term seepage” to deny coverage.</li>
                    <li>Rejecting mitigation scope as excessive without offering alternatives.</li>
                    <li>Applying mold sublimits broadly to non-mold repairs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delayed inspections allowing conditions to worsen.</li>
                    <li>Demands for tear-out without agreeing to restore or pay resulting damages.</li>
                    <li>Denials that ignore moisture logs or expert findings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start mitigation immediately and keep thorough, dated records.</li>
                    <li>Communicate discoveries in real time to expand scope properly.</li>
                    <li>Request written explanations for any denial of mitigation or mold-related items.</li>
                </ul>
