                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Business interruption (BI) covers lost income and extra expense resulting from direct physical loss at the insured location, subject to policy terms. The period of restoration begins at the date of loss and extends through the time reasonably needed to repair or replace damaged property. Civil authority, contingent business interruption, and ingress/egress may apply when access is restricted or key suppliers/customers are impaired.</p>
                <p>Policies typically require proof of pre-loss income and expenses, along with evidence linking the interruption to covered physical damage. Extra expense covers costs to reduce suspension (temporary relocation, overtime, expedited shipping) and may be payable even if they increase total spend when they reduce or avoid greater loss.</p>
                <p>Documentation and modeling are crucial: use historical financials, seasonality adjustments, and reasonable projections. Track mitigation decisions and rationale. Communicate frequently with the carrier about timelines for repairs and reopening.</p>
                <p>Ordinary payroll, extended period of indemnity, and deductible application can materially change outcomes; review these provisions early. Align construction schedules, permitting timelines, and vendor lead times with the period of restoration analysis.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>BI generally requires direct physical loss to trigger coverage unless specific extensions apply.</li>
                    <li>The period of restoration is limited to reasonable repair/replacement time—not business decisions unrelated to damage.</li>
                    <li>Extra expense is intended to reduce or avoid suspension; track cost-benefit.</li>
                    <li>Provide contemporaneous financials: P&L, tax returns, payroll, and sales data.</li>
                    <li>Apply policy provisions on ordinary payroll, waiting periods, and extended indemnity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Confirm physical damage trigger and note the exact start of the period of restoration.</li>
                    <li>Assemble pre-loss financials (12–24 months), budgets, and seasonality data.</li>
                    <li>Track lost revenue, saved expenses, and extra expenses with invoices and narratives.</li>
                    <li>Coordinate repair timelines and reopening plans; update projections as schedules evolve.</li>
                    <li>Submit interim BI calculations to the carrier and adjust as actuals develop.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial statements, tax returns, sales reports, and payroll registers.</li>
                    <li>Repair schedules, contractor estimates, and occupancy/permit milestones.</li>
                    <li>Invoices and receipts for extra expense and mitigation costs.</li>
                    <li>Narratives linking lost revenue to the covered event and timeline.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Narrowly interpreting “physical loss” to avoid triggering BI coverage.</li>
                    <li>Reducing projected revenue by using atypical periods or ignoring seasonality.</li>
                    <li>Disallowing extra expense if not tied to a demonstrable reduction in loss.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assumptions that business would have declined regardless of the loss without evidence.</li>
                    <li>Ignoring documented supply chain or customer access impacts.</li>
                    <li>Delays in approving reasonable temporary relocation or equipment rentals.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engage accounting support early to model losses and track mitigation impacts.</li>
                    <li>Provide periodic updates with actuals vs. projections to maintain transparency.</li>
                    <li>Align repair milestones with BI claims; document reasons for any schedule changes.</li>
                </ul>
