                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Fire claims involve multiple perils—heat, smoke, soot, and water from suppression. Cause and origin investigations inform coverage, subrogation, and safety. Insurers often deploy origin-and-cause experts; policyholders may engage independent experts when findings conflict. Scope must address structural damage, HVAC contamination, contents cleaning vs. replacement, and specialty cleaning for electronics and textiles.</p>
                <p>Smoke infiltration can impact hidden cavities, insulation, and ductwork; testing and clearance protocols are key. Water used to extinguish fires can create secondary moisture and mold risks if not dried promptly. Separate structural, contents, and additional living expense/business interruption components for clarity.</p>
                <p>Inventory requirements are rigorous: list items, age, condition, brand, and values. Salvage decisions should be documented; some items require specialized restoration. Keep chain-of-custody for any evidence tied to subrogation potential.</p>
                <p>Timely mitigation (board-up, tarping, drying) protects coverage and reduces disputes. Request carrier estimates and vendor scopes, and reconcile line by line with your contractors.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify all damage types: heat, charring, smoke, soot, and water.</li>
                    <li>Preserve evidence relevant to cause and origin; avoid disturbing key areas until documented.</li>
                    <li>Comprehensive cleaning protocols may include HVAC cleaning, sealing, and deodorization.</li>
                    <li>Contents inventories must be detailed; cleaning vs. replacement decisions need justification.</li>
                    <li>Mitigation (board-up, tarping, drying) is required to prevent further loss.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Secure the site: board-up, tarp, and ensure utilities are safe.</li>
                    <li>Request carrier inspection and origin-and-cause evaluation; document your own photos immediately.</li>
                    <li>Begin drying and soot containment; obtain environmental testing if smoke impact is significant.</li>
                    <li>Develop separate scopes for structure and contents, including cleaning vs. replacement decisions.</li>
                    <li>Track additional living expenses or business interruption impacts with receipts and logs.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cause-and-origin reports and fire department documents.</li>
                    <li>Structural and contents inventories with condition, age, and pricing.</li>
                    <li>Mitigation invoices (board-up, drying, cleaning) and environmental test results.</li>
                    <li>Contractor estimates and proof of repairs; ALE/BI expense logs and receipts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limiting smoke cleaning to visible areas while excluding hidden cavities.</li>
                    <li>Applying aggressive depreciation to contents without considering condition.</li>
                    <li>Delaying ALE/BI payments pending structural scope resolution.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pressure to discard items before they are inventoried or evaluated.</li>
                    <li>Refusals to test HVAC or interior cavities despite heavy smoke exposure.</li>
                    <li>Estimates omitting code upgrades or specialty trades (electrical, HVAC, restoration).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain control of inventories; photograph and label rooms before removal.</li>
                    <li>Request detailed cleaning protocols and clearance criteria in writing.</li>
                    <li>Keep ALE/BI documentation organized and submit regularly for reimbursement.</li>
                </ul>
