                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Mandatory carrier timelines govern how quickly insurers must acknowledge, investigate, decide, and pay claims. These clocks are set by state regulations and policy language, and they differ for catastrophe and non-cat events. Timelines protect policyholders from indefinite delays and require clear communication when more time is needed.</p>
                <p>Common standards include prompt acknowledgment, timely scheduling of inspections, regular status updates, and payment within a defined period after liability is established. Some states pause timelines when information is outstanding, but carriers must clearly request needed documents and cannot delay unreasonably.</p>
                <p>Policyholders should compare carrier conduct against state rules and request written explanations if milestones slip. Where payments are split (undisputed vs. disputed amounts), undisputed benefits should be issued promptly while disputes continue.</p>
                <p>Tracking timelines helps determine when to escalate, demand written explanations, or seek regulatory assistance. Keeping evidence of delays strengthens later requests for interest or penalties where allowed.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carriers must acknowledge claims and communications within state-defined timeframes.</li>
                    <li>Inspections should be scheduled promptly; delays require explanation and alternative options.</li>
                    <li>Coverage decisions must be communicated in writing with policy citations within required deadlines.</li>
                    <li>Undisputed amounts must be paid promptly once liability is established.</li>
                    <li>Status updates should be provided regularly until final resolution.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log all key dates: loss, notice, acknowledgment, inspection, requests, and payments.</li>
                    <li>Ask the carrier to state its expected timeline for inspection and decision in writing.</li>
                    <li>Provide requested documents quickly and confirm receipt to avoid excuses for delay.</li>
                    <li>If deadlines slip, request a written status update and rationale tied to state standards.</li>
                    <li>Escalate to supervisors or DOI if delays continue without clear justification.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication log with timestamps of all calls, emails, and letters.</li>
                    <li>Inspection reports and correspondence confirming scheduling attempts.</li>
                    <li>Decision letters showing dates sent and policy provisions cited.</li>
                    <li>Payment records with amounts, dates, and descriptions (undisputed vs. disputed).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Citing “ongoing investigation” without providing specific outstanding items.</li>
                    <li>Delaying inspections through repeated rescheduling or adjuster changes.</li>
                    <li>Holding undisputed funds until all disputes are resolved.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>No written decision within expected timelines.</li>
                    <li>Requests for the same documents multiple times without reason.</li>
                    <li>Silence after providing all requested information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain a clear, dated timeline and share it during escalations.</li>
                    <li>Ask for written explanations that reference state timing requirements.</li>
                    <li>Request partial (undisputed) payments promptly when coverage is acknowledged.</li>
                </ul>
