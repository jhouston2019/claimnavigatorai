                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Bad faith refers to insurer conduct that is unreasonable, unfair, or reckless toward the policyholder’s interests. States define unfair claims practices and impose duties of good faith and fair dealing. While thresholds and remedies vary, carriers must investigate promptly, evaluate fairly, and pay what is owed without undue delay.</p>
                <p>Indicators include ignoring evidence, unreasonably low valuations, withholding policy provisions, or failing to explain coverage positions. Some states require notice and an opportunity to cure before pursuing bad-faith remedies. Documenting the claim record is crucial to demonstrate patterns of unfair conduct.</p>
                <p>Bad faith is fact-specific: a single error is not always bad faith, but repeated neglect, unreasonable delay, or intentional underpayment can be. Clear, written communication and escalation to supervisors or compliance can often correct behavior before litigation.</p>
                <p>Policyholders should avoid speculation; focus on documenting missed deadlines, unsupported denials, and refusal to consider relevant evidence. Regulatory complaints can spotlight systemic issues and prompt corrective action.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Insurers must conduct reasonable, timely investigations and consider all provided evidence.</li>
                    <li>Coverage positions must cite specific policy provisions and relevant facts.</li>
                    <li>Payments for undisputed amounts must not be withheld while disputes continue.</li>
                    <li>Lowball offers without support may breach fair-valuation duties.</li>
                    <li>Some states require notice and opportunity to cure before bad-faith claims proceed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Maintain a detailed claim file with timelines, communications, and evidence submitted.</li>
                    <li>Request written explanations for any adverse decisions, citing policy provisions and facts.</li>
                    <li>If valuations are low, ask for the adjuster’s estimate, methodology, and supporting photos or notes.</li>
                    <li>Escalate to supervisors or compliance when deadlines lapse or responses lack substance.</li>
                    <li>If issues persist, consider regulatory complaint or legal counsel; follow any required notice-to-cure steps.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Complete communication log and copies of all carrier letters/emails.</li>
                    <li>Insurer estimates, reports, and basis for payments or denials.</li>
                    <li>Policy excerpts relevant to coverage, duties, and valuation.</li>
                    <li>Independent estimates, photos, expert reports supporting the claim.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issuing verbal denials without written policy citations.</li>
                    <li>Delaying payments by repeatedly requesting already-provided documents.</li>
                    <li>Using extreme depreciation or omitted line items to suppress valuations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Refusal to share the carrier’s estimate or basis for valuation.</li>
                    <li>Unexplained months-long delays despite completed inspections.</li>
                    <li>Denials relying on broad exclusions without analyzing facts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep communications professional and evidence-based; avoid speculation.</li>
                    <li>Request written decisions and estimates to create a clear record.</li>
                    <li>Escalate early when timelines or valuation support are lacking; document every escalation.</li>
                </ul>
