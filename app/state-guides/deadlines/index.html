                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Deadlines drive claim viability. Every state sets clocks for notice of loss, proof of loss submission, insurer acknowledgment, investigation, payment, and suit limitation. Missing a deadline can reduce coverage, shorten the recoverable depreciation window, or bar litigation. Policy terms can shorten statutory periods, but cannot extend statutory minimums for fair claims handling. Deadlines differ by line (homeowners, commercial property, surplus lines) and catastrophe status. Calendar management is essential because some clocks pause for uncontrollable delays while others do not.</p>
                <p>Policyholders should log the date of loss, date of first notice, dates of every insurer communication, and any tolling agreements. Most states expect carriers to give clear, written deadline guidance when they request documents or examinations under oath. When deadlines are unclear, request confirmation in writing and escalate to supervisors or compliance contacts.</p>
                <p>Litigation filing deadlines (suit limitation clauses) often run from the date of loss, not from denial. Courts sometimes toll these clauses during ongoing adjustment, but relying on tolling without written agreement is risky. Calendar statutory bad-faith notice prerequisites separately, because missing them can bar extra-contractual remedies.</p>
                <p>Extensions should be requested before a deadline expires and documented with reasons (e.g., delayed contractor reports, unsafe access, disaster-area restrictions). Keep copies of all correspondence so you can prove diligence if timeliness is challenged.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide prompt notice of loss per policy, then follow up in writing to confirm receipt and claim number.</li>
                    <li>Submit sworn proof of loss within the policy or state timeframe; request a brief extension if supporting documents are pending.</li>
                    <li>Track insurer acknowledgment and communication deadlines; most states require timely responses and status updates.</li>
                    <li>Calendar suit limitation dates separately from statutory bad-faith notice or appraisal deadlines.</li>
                    <li>Document any agreed extensions or tolling in writing with clear start and end dates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Record the date of loss and review the policy’s duties after loss and suit limitation clause.</li>
                    <li>Send written notice with date of loss, cause, and contact info; request confirmation and assigned adjuster.</li>
                    <li>Log all insurer deadlines (proof of loss, documents, EUO, inspection) and add reminders well before each date.</li>
                    <li>If more time is needed, request extensions in writing with a specific new date and reason; follow up until confirmed.</li>
                    <li>Before any suit limitation runs, consult counsel and seek written tolling if adjustment is ongoing.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dated notice of loss correspondence and insurer acknowledgment.</li>
                    <li>Sworn proof of loss with supporting schedules and estimates.</li>
                    <li>Timeline log of all communications, inspections, and requests.</li>
                    <li>Written extension or tolling confirmations, if any.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Issuing broad document requests without clear due dates, then alleging delay.</li>
                    <li>Relying on suit limitation language to bar claims after prolonged adjustment.</li>
                    <li>Resetting internal timelines after reassignment without notifying the insured.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of written acknowledgment or claim number after initial notice.</li>
                    <li>Silence on extension requests when deadlines are imminent.</li>
                    <li>Sudden denial citing late proof of loss despite earlier cooperation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain a deadline tracker with policy, statutory, and agreed dates.</li>
                    <li>Send all key communications by email and retain read receipts.</li>
                    <li>Confirm any verbal deadline guidance in writing the same day.</li>
                </ul>
