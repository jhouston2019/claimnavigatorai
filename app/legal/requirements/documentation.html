                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Documentation is the backbone of claim evaluation. Policies require cooperation and proof of loss, but documentation must be reasonable and tied to the claimed damage. Providing organized evidence accelerates payment and limits disputes. Insurers must explain what they need and why; broad or repetitive demands should be clarified in writing.</p>
                <p>For property claims, documentation spans photos, estimates, inventories, mitigation records, and receipts. For business interruption, it includes financials and narratives linking loss to the covered event. All documentation should be dated, labeled, and consistent with the timeline of loss.</p>
                <p>Policyholders should retain originals when possible and send copies. If an item is unavailable, explain why and offer alternatives (affidavits, bank records, vendor statements). Maintaining a centralized document log helps track submissions and prevents “missing document” disputes.</p>
                <p>Regulators expect carriers to request only what is needed and to act promptly upon receipt. When requests are unclear, ask for specifics and cite prior submissions to avoid duplication.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide proof of loss and supporting documents within policy timelines or agreed extensions.</li>
                    <li>Requests must be reasonable and related to coverage, causation, or valuation.</li>
                    <li>Keep a submission log (date sent, method, contents) for all materials provided.</li>
                    <li>Preserve originals when possible; send clear copies and backups.</li>
                    <li>Clarify repetitive or overly broad requests and confirm receipt in writing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a document index by category: photos, estimates, invoices, inventories, financials.</li>
                    <li>Submit proof of loss with key exhibits; label each exhibit clearly.</li>
                    <li>Respond to insurer requests promptly; cite previously provided documents with dates.</li>
                    <li>Provide alternative proof when primary documents are unavailable.</li>
                    <li>Maintain a running log of all submissions and confirmations.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proof of loss with schedules and signatures.</li>
                    <li>Photos/videos, estimates, invoices, and receipts tied to the loss.</li>
                    <li>Contents inventories or financial records for BI/extra expense.</li>
                    <li>Communication log and submission receipts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Broad document sweeps without specifying purpose.</li>
                    <li>Claiming non-receipt of items that were previously sent.</li>
                    <li>Delaying decisions pending “complete” documentation without defining completeness.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repeated requests for the same documents without explanation.</li>
                    <li>Demands for unrelated personal records not tied to coverage.</li>
                    <li>Lack of written acknowledgment after submissions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a consistent file naming system and index for all submissions.</li>
                    <li>Send documents via trackable email or portal and save confirmations.</li>
                    <li>Politely push back on overbroad requests and offer targeted alternatives.</li>
                </ul>
