                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Carriers owe duties of good faith and fair dealing, grounded in policy contracts and state unfair claims practices acts. They must investigate promptly, communicate clearly, and pay covered benefits without unreasonable delay. Obligations extend to explaining coverage positions, providing estimates or bases for payments, and issuing undisputed amounts while disputes continue.</p>
                <p>Written explanations should cite policy provisions and facts. Adjusters must be licensed where required and act within authority. When coverage is uncertain, carriers may reserve rights, but they must still investigate and pay undisputed portions.</p>
                <p>Carriers must consider all evidence provided, not selectively rely on facts that support denial. Vendor or expert selections should be appropriate and conflict-free. Payment timing is regulated; interest or penalties may accrue for late payments in some jurisdictions.</p>
                <p>Policyholders can hold carriers accountable by requesting written status updates, bases for valuation, and clarification of any conditions precedent to payment.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acknowledge and respond to communications within regulated timeframes.</li>
                    <li>Conduct reasonable investigations and inspections using qualified personnel.</li>
                    <li>Provide written coverage positions citing policy language and facts.</li>
                    <li>Pay undisputed amounts promptly; do not withhold pending unrelated disputes.</li>
                    <li>Disclose bases for valuations and allow reconsideration when new evidence is provided.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Request written acknowledgment of the claim and assigned adjuster contact information.</li>
                    <li>Ask for inspection timelines and what documents are needed to complete the investigation.</li>
                    <li>When payments or denials are issued, request the estimate, methodology, and policy citations.</li>
                    <li>Submit supplemental evidence with a cover note asking for reconsideration of prior decisions.</li>
                    <li>If obligations are not met, escalate internally and, if necessary, to the Department of Insurance.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Policy and declarations page highlighting applicable coverages.</li>
                    <li>Communication log and all written carrier responses.</li>
                    <li>Carrier estimates, reports, and payment summaries.</li>
                    <li>Supplemental evidence (photos, invoices, expert reports) supporting requested adjustments.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offering lump-sum payments without detailed estimates or bases.</li>
                    <li>Delaying undisputed payments until all disputes are resolved.</li>
                    <li>Using vendor findings without providing underlying reports.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reservations of rights issued without continuing investigation or payment of undisputed amounts.</li>
                    <li>Refusal to provide estimates or basis for valuation changes.</li>
                    <li>Unlicensed adjusters or repeated adjuster turnover causing resets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Request written explanations and detailed estimates for every payment or denial.</li>
                    <li>Track timelines and cite regulatory standards when asking for status updates.</li>
                    <li>Escalate promptly if undisputed amounts are withheld without justification.</li>
                </ul>
