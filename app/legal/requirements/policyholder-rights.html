                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Policyholders are entitled to fair treatment, timely communication, and payment of covered benefits. State unfair claims practices acts set minimum standards, while policies define duties after loss. Rights include clear explanations of coverage positions, reasonable investigations, and prompt payment of undisputed amounts.</p>
                <p>Consumers can request status updates, written decisions with policy citations, and access to non-privileged claim file materials in many states. They may also pursue appraisal or mediation if provided in the policy or by regulation. Complaints to the Department of Insurance can address systemic delays or noncompliance.</p>
                <p>Rights are balanced by duties: prompt notice, cooperation, protection of property, and providing requested documents within reason. Understanding both sides reduces friction and prevents avoidable disputes.</p>
                <p>Policyholders should communicate professionally, maintain detailed records, and seek clarification when instructions or deadlines are unclear.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Receive timely acknowledgment, investigation, and written explanations for decisions.</li>
                    <li>Obtain payment of undisputed amounts without delay while disputes continue.</li>
                    <li>Access policy terms and applicable endorsements; request copies if not on hand.</li>
                    <li>Request status updates and, where allowed, portions of the claim file.</li>
                    <li>Use contractual or regulatory dispute options (appraisal, mediation, complaint) when needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Review the policy to understand duties after loss and available dispute mechanisms.</li>
                    <li>Document the loss and notify the carrier promptly; request acknowledgment and adjuster contact.</li>
                    <li>Ask for written explanations of any partial or full denial with policy citations.</li>
                    <li>Escalate for status updates if timelines lapse; consider mediation or appraisal if appropriate.</li>
                    <li>File a DOI complaint when fair-claims standards appear unmet and internal escalation fails.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Policy and endorsements; proof of coverage in force.</li>
                    <li>Communication log with dates, senders, and substance of responses.</li>
                    <li>Decision letters, estimates, and payment records.</li>
                    <li>Evidence supporting disputed items (photos, reports, invoices).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing verbal positions without written policy citations.</li>
                    <li>Delaying undisputed payments to leverage settlements.</li>
                    <li>Limiting access to claim file materials while relying on them for decisions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Missed acknowledgment or decision timelines without explanation.</li>
                    <li>Refusal to provide policy provisions or basis for denial.</li>
                    <li>Pressure to settle quickly without showing supporting estimates.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep organized records and summarize requests in writing.</li>
                    <li>Ask for detailed written decisions and challenge inaccuracies promptly.</li>
                    <li>Use available dispute tools (appraisal, mediation, DOI complaint) when cooperation stalls.</li>
                </ul>
