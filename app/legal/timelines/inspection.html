                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Inspection timelines ensure prompt evaluation of damage. States expect carriers to schedule and complete inspections within a reasonable period after notice of loss, adjusted for access and safety. Delayed inspections can worsen damage and prolong displacement; carriers should offer alternatives if access is constrained.</p>
                <p>Inspections must be thorough and documented. Multiple inspections may occur (initial, specialist, reinspection). Policyholders can request copies of photos and notes to verify accuracy. If the property is unsafe, remote or phased inspections should be considered.</p>
                <p>When coverage decisions depend on specialized findings (engineering, environmental, roofing), carriers should engage qualified experts timely. Policyholders may provide their own experts to address disagreements.</p>
                <p>Maintaining a clear schedule and providing access promptly supports the claim and counters delay arguments.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspections should be scheduled promptly after notice of loss, subject to access and safety.</li>
                    <li>Carriers must communicate inspection dates and changes clearly.</li>
                    <li>Specialist inspections (engineering, HVAC, roof) should occur without undue delay.</li>
                    <li>Policyholders should receive findings or have an opportunity to respond to them.</li>
                    <li>Reasonable accommodations (remote review, partial access) should be used if full access is not possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Confirm inspection date, time, and scope in writing; provide access instructions.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the site: ensure safety, preserve evidence, and identify key damaged areas.</li>
                    <li>Attend if possible, or have a representative present to point out damage and answer questions.</li>
                    <li>Request copies of photos and notes; clarify any missed areas promptly.</li>
                    <li>If specialized inspection is needed, ask for expected timing and scope; schedule your expert if disputes arise.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inspection scheduling confirmations and any reschedule notices.</li>
                    <li>Carrier and expert reports, photos, and notes.</li>
                    <li>Your own photos and notes from the inspection day.</li>
                    <li>Access or safety limitations communicated to the carrier.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delaying specialist inspections to postpone decisions.</li>
                    <li>Conducting brief inspections without documenting all areas.</li>
                    <li>Relying on remote assessments without considering on-site evidence.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repeated cancellations or no-shows without prompt rescheduling.</li>
                    <li>Reports that omit areas you flagged during the visit.</li>
                    <li>Decisions based on inspections you were never notified about.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be present or represented; guide the inspector to all affected areas.</li>
                    <li>Follow up after inspections to confirm next steps and expected decision dates.</li>
                    <li>Engage your own experts when specialized issues are disputed.</li>
                </ul>
