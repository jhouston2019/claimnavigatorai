                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Undisputed payment requirements obligate carriers to pay amounts they agree are owed without waiting for full claim resolution. Once liability and amount are clear, prompt issuance is required under fair claims standards. Holding undisputed funds to gain leverage in disputes can be improper.</p>
                <p>Policyholders should request written confirmation of undisputed amounts and expected payment dates. Payments should align with the carrier’s estimate; if supplements are pending, the undisputed portion should still be released.</p>
                <p>Delays in undisputed payments can prolong repairs, increase additional living expenses, and harm businesses. Some jurisdictions allow interest or penalties for late payment; documenting dates supports those remedies.</p>
                <p>Clear separation of undisputed vs. disputed items helps maintain momentum and ensures partial benefits flow while discussions continue.</p>

                <h2>Key Rules & Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Undisputed amounts must be paid promptly once established.</li>
                    <li>Payments should be supported by estimates or written calculations.</li>
                    <li>Disputed items do not justify withholding agreed portions.</li>
                    <li>Payment timing may be regulated; interest can accrue for late payments in some states.</li>
                    <li>Carrier communications should state what is undisputed and what remains under review.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guidance</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Request the carrier’s written estimate and identification of undisputed line items.</li>
                    <li>Confirm expected payment date for undisputed amounts; track issuance.</li>
                    <li>If payment is delayed, send a written reminder citing fair claims standards.</li>
                    <li>Continue submitting supplements for disputed items with supporting evidence.</li>
                    <li>Escalate to supervisors or DOI if undisputed payments are withheld without cause.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Required Documentation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carrier estimate and payment explanation.</li>
                    <li>Payment records (checks, EFT confirmations) with dates.</li>
                    <li>Communication log requesting and confirming undisputed amounts.</li>
                    <li>Supplemental evidence for disputed items.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Insurer Tactics</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bundling undisputed and disputed items to delay any payment.</li>
                    <li>Issuing partial payments without explaining withheld items.</li>
                    <li>Requiring unnecessary approvals before releasing agreed funds.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Payment offers that lack breakdowns or references to the estimate.</li>
                    <li>Undisputed amounts promised verbally but not issued.</li>
                    <li>“Pending full resolution” cited as the reason for withholding agreed portions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Best Practices for Policyholders</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask for written confirmation of undisputed amounts and payment timing.</li>
                    <li>Keep a payment ledger to track dates and amounts received.</li>
                    <li>Escalate promptly if undisputed funds are delayed; provide the timeline in writing.</li>
                </ul>
