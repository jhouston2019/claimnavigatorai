# ClaimNavigatorAI Document Templates

This directory contains document templates grouped by category. In production, these files should be populated with finalized DOCX/PDF templates. The backend also dynamically generates basic versions if a template file is missing so downloads still work.

Structure:
- claims/
- letters/
- logs/
- guides/
- briefs/

Populate with at least 20 templates (DOCX or PDF) corresponding to names used by get-template.js.
