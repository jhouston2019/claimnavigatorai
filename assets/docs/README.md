ClaimNavigatorAI Templates

This directory holds downloadable template assets used by the Response Center.

Expected files (you can replace these with real templates in production):

- core/fnol-template.docx
- core/proof-of-loss.docx
- core/claim-sequence-guide.pdf
- escalation/appeal-letter.docx
- escalation/demand-letter.docx
- specialty/evidence-log.xlsx

If a specific asset is not present, the get-template function will generate a placeholder DOCX/PDF/CSV on-the-fly so the app continues to work. Replace the placeholders by dropping real files with the exact same names and extensions above.
