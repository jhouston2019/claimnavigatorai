RE: Demand for Payment - [CLAIM DESCRIPTION]

Dear [CLAIMS ADJUSTER NAME],

I am writing to formally demand payment for the claim referenced above. Despite multiple attempts to resolve this matter amicably, your company has failed to provide adequate compensation for the covered losses under my insurance policy.

BACKGROUND:
On [LOSS DATE], I experienced a covered loss at [LOCATION]. I immediately reported this loss to your company and have cooperated fully with your investigation. The loss was caused by [CAUSE OF LOSS], which is clearly covered under my policy.

COVERAGE ANALYSIS:
My policy provides coverage for [TYPE OF COVERAGE] with limits of $[COVERAGE LIMIT]. The damages sustained total $[DAMAGE AMOUNT], which is well within the policy limits. Your company's initial offer of $[INITIAL OFFER] is inadequate and does not reflect the true value of my loss.

SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
I have provided the following documentation to support my claim:
- [LIST OF DOCUMENTS PROVIDED]
- [PHOTOGRAPHS AND ESTIMATES]
- [EXPERT OPINIONS IF APPLICABLE]

LEGAL BASIS:
Under [STATE] law and the terms of my insurance policy, your company has a duty to:
1. Act in good faith when handling claims
2. Provide prompt, fair, and equitable settlements
3. Not unreasonably delay payment of claims
4. Conduct a thorough investigation

Your company's failure to provide adequate compensation constitutes a breach of these duties and may give rise to additional legal remedies.

DEMAND:
I hereby demand payment of $[FULL CLAIM AMOUNT] within [TIMEFRAME] days of receipt of this letter. This amount represents the full value of my covered loss.

If payment is not received within the specified timeframe, I will have no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to:
- Filing a complaint with the [STATE] Department of Insurance
- Pursuing legal action for breach of contract
- Seeking damages for bad faith insurance practices

I remain willing to discuss settlement of this matter, but any further delay will only increase the potential liability to your company.

Please contact me immediately to resolve this matter. I can be reached at [PHONE] or [EMAIL].

Sincerely,

[YOUR NAME]
