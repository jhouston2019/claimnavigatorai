Demand for Fair Settlement

Dear Claims Adjuster,

I am writing to formally demand a fair and adequate settlement for my insurance claim referenced above. The current settlement offer is significantly below the actual value of my covered loss.

**Situation Summary:**
{{situation_summary}}

**Current Settlement Issues:**

1. **Inadequate Assessment**: The damage assessment appears to be incomplete and does not account for all covered losses.

2. **Below-Market Pricing**: The repair/replacement costs used in your estimate are significantly below current market rates for quality materials and labor.

3. **Omitted Items**: Several damaged items and necessary repairs were not included in your assessment.

4. **Depreciation Dispute**: The depreciation applied appears excessive and does not reflect the actual condition of the items.

**Supporting Documentation:**

I have obtained independent estimates and documentation that support a higher settlement amount:

- Professional contractor estimates showing current market rates
- Receipts and invoices for temporary repairs and expenses
- Expert opinions on the extent and cause of damage
- Comparable replacement costs for damaged items

**Demand for Action:**

1. **Immediate Reinspection**: I request a reinspection of the damage by a qualified adjuster who will properly assess all covered losses.

2. **Fair Settlement**: I demand a settlement that reflects the actual cost to repair or replace damaged property with materials of like kind and quality.

3. **Written Response**: Please provide a detailed written response to this demand within 10 business days.

4. **Settlement Timeline**: I expect resolution of this matter within 30 days of your receipt of this letter.

**Legal Notice:**

If this matter is not resolved fairly and promptly, I reserve all rights under my insurance policy and applicable state law, including but not limited to:

- Filing a complaint with the state insurance department
- Pursuing legal remedies for bad faith insurance practices
- Requesting an independent appraisal as provided under my policy
- Seeking recovery of additional damages and attorney fees

I am confident that a fair review of the evidence will result in an appropriate settlement. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
