RE: Demand for Appraisal Pursuant to Policy Terms

Dear Claims Department:

I am writing to formally demand appraisal pursuant to the terms and conditions of the above-referenced insurance policy. There exists a dispute regarding the amount of loss and damage to my property.

DISPUTE DETAILS:
The insurance company's estimate of ${{Insurer Estimate}} is significantly lower than the actual cost to repair or replace the damaged property. My estimate shows damages of ${{Insured Estimate}}, creating a dispute of ${{Dispute Amount}}.

POLICY PROVISION:
Pursuant to the appraisal clause in the policy, I hereby demand that appraisal be invoked to resolve this dispute. The policy provides:

"Appraisal. If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent and impartial appraiser. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the residence premises is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of loss."

SELECTION OF APPRAISERS:
I have selected {{Insured Appraiser}} as my appraiser. Please provide the name and contact information of your selected appraiser within 15 days of receipt of this demand.

TIMELINE:
Pursuant to the policy terms, I expect the appraisal process to be completed within 60 days of the selection of the umpire.

This demand is made in good faith to resolve the dispute regarding the amount of loss. I look forward to your prompt response and cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely,

{{Insured Name}}
