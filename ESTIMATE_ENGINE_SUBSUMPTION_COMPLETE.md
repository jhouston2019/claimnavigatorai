# ESTIMATE ENGINE SUBSUMPTION - EXECUTION COMPLETE

**Date:** January 3, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Engine:** Estimate Review Pro → Claim Command Pro

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Estimate Review Pro estimate intelligence has been successfully absorbed into Claim Command Pro. All estimate-related functionality now operates through a single canonical engine with identical behavioral characteristics to Estimate Review Pro.

**Result:** Claim Command Pro estimate analysis is behaviorally indistinguishable from Estimate Review Pro under all tested conditions.

---

## WHAT WAS DONE

### Phase 1: Engine Extraction ✅

**Created:** `app/assets/js/intelligence/estimate-engine.js`

Extracted all non-UI logic from Estimate Review Pro into a headless engine module:

- **Classification Engine:** Property/Auto/Commercial classification with keyword scoring
- **Line Item Analysis:** Category detection, scope gap identification, under-scoping patterns
- **Output Formatting:** Neutral findings report generation
- **Guardrails Engine:** Prohibited phrase detection, request validation
- **Main Orchestrator:** Full analysis pipeline coordination

**Key Characteristics:**
- Zero UI dependencies (no DOM, no CSS)
- Deterministic behavior preserved
- Temperature 0.2 logic maintained
- All ERP safety constraints intact
- Dual export (Node.js + Browser)

### Phase 2: Backend Function Replacement ✅

#### Updated: `netlify/functions/ai-estimate-comparison.js`

**Before:** Generic OpenAI-based estimate comparison (temperature 0.7)  
**After:** Estimate Review Pro engine with identical analysis behavior

**Changes:**
- Deleted all OpenAI prompt-based logic
- Integrated EstimateEngine.analyzeEstimate()
- Preserved authentication and logging
- Added engine result formatting
- Maintained API contract (no breaking changes)

**Impact:** Steps 4 & 5 now use canonical engine

#### Created: `netlify/functions/coverage-alignment-estimate.js`

**Purpose:** Step 9 - Coverage Alignment  
**Engine:** Estimate Review Pro  
**Function:** Analyzes estimates and maps to policy coverages

**Capabilities:**
- Estimate classification and analysis
- Coverage mapping generation
- Potential gap identification
- Policy limit impact analysis
- Neutral alignment observations

#### Created: `netlify/functions/supplement-analysis-estimate.js`

**Purpose:** Step 13 - Supplement & Underpayment Analysis  
**Engine:** Estimate Review Pro  
**Function:** Compares estimates and identifies discrepancies

**Capabilities:**
- Multi-estimate analysis (original, carrier, supplement)
- Scope comparison between estimates
- Structural discrepancy detection
- Supplement justification generation
- Neutral underpayment observations

### Phase 3: Step Integration ✅

All four estimate-related steps now use the same engine:

| Step | Tool ID | Function | Engine | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| 4 | estimate-review | ai-estimate-comparison.js | ERP | ✅ Active |
| 5 | estimate-comparison | ai-estimate-comparison.js | ERP | ✅ Active |
| 9 | coverage-alignment | coverage-alignment-estimate.js | ERP | ✅ Active |
| 13 | supplement-analysis | supplement-analysis-estimate.js | ERP | ✅ Active |

**No UI Changes Required:** Existing frontend tools (`estimates.html`, `policy.html`, `settlement.html`) continue to work without modification.

### Phase 4: Behavioral Verification ✅

**Created:** `tests/estimate-engine-parity-test.js`

**Test Results:**
```
Total Tests: 6
✅ Passed: 6
❌ Failed: 0

🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! Engine behavior matches Estimate Review Pro.
```

**Test Coverage:**
1. ✅ Valid Property Estimate (classification, confidence, categories)
2. ✅ Valid Auto Estimate (classification, category detection)
3. ✅ Ambiguous Estimate (proper rejection)
4. ✅ Prohibited Language (guardrails enforcement)
5. ✅ Missing Categories (detection accuracy)
6. ✅ Zero Quantities (under-scoping detection)
