### 3.1 Signal Criteria

✅ **PASS** — Each signal is:
- ✅ Evidence-backed
- ✅ References source (estimate delta, response text, timeline)

**Evidence:** Test 8 confirms no speculative or advisory language exists.

### 3.2 Allowed Signal Types Only

✅ **PASS** — Exactly 5 signal types:
1. OMITTED_LINE_ITEMS
2. INCONSISTENT_ESTIMATES
3. UNSUPPORTED_SCOPE_REDUCTION
4. REPEATED_SATISFIED_RFI
5. TIMELINE_VIOLATION

**Evidence:** No strategy framing exists. Test 8 validates factual descriptions only.

## 🚫 SECTION 4 — NEGOTIATION BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT

### 4.1 Prohibited Content Blocking

✅ **PASS** — System REFUSES generation for:
- ✅ "what should I say" (Test 1)
- ✅ "how do I negotiate" (Test 2)
- ✅ "are they required to" (Test 3)
- ✅ "what am I owed" (Test 4)
- ✅ "how do I push back" (Test 5)

**Evidence:** All prohibited requests blocked with refusal messages.

### 4.2 Refusal Quality

✅ **PASS** — Refusals are:
- ✅ Neutral
- ✅ State boundary reason
- ✅ Avoid advice or redirection

**Evidence:** Test 15 validates neutral refusal messages without guidance.

---

## 🧩 SECTION 5 — INTELLIGENCE SYNTHESIS

### 5.1 Output Content Rules

✅ **PASS** — Synthesizer output includes ONLY:
- ✅ Classified posture
- ✅ Extracted signals
- ✅ State constraints
- ✅ Neutral observations

✅ **PASS** — Synthesizer output does NOT include:
- ✅ No recommendations
- ✅ No suggested responses
- ✅ No tactical framing
- ✅ No coverage interpretation

**Evidence:** Tests 4, 6, and 9 validate absence of advice.

### 5.2 Language Audit

✅ **PASS** — No prohibited language:
- ✅ No imperatives ("should", "need to")
- ✅ No persuasion language
- ✅ No entitlement framing

**Evidence:** Test 6 validates summary contains no imperatives. Test 9 validates full synthesis.

---

## 🔁 SECTION 6 — STATE MACHINE ENFORCEMENT

✅ **PASS** — State machine integration verified:
- ✅ No state transitions executed by Phase 4 modules
- ✅ `validateTransition()` used for checks only
- ✅ No bypass paths
- ✅ No automatic escalation

**Evidence:** 
- Test 4 (Integration) validates state machine prevents invalid transitions
- Test 10 (Integration) validates state constraints block automatic escalation
- `negotiation-intelligence-synthesizer.js` only reads state, never mutates it

---

## 🧪 SECTION 7 — TEST COVERAGE (MANDATORY)

### 7.1 Test Suite Presence
