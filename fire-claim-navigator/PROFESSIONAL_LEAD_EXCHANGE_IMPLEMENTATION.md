# Professional Lead Exchange Implementation

This document outlines the complete implementation of the Professional Lead Exchange system for ClaimNavigatorAI.

## Overview

The Professional Lead Exchange is a B2B platform that allows insurance professionals (public adjusters, attorneys, contractors, consultants) to purchase claim leads from policyholders who have submitted their information through the intake form.

## Architecture

### Database Schema

The system uses the following Supabase tables:

1. **leads** - Stores claim information from policyholders
2. **professionals** - Stores professional user profiles
3. **professional_transactions** - Tracks all purchases and payments

### Key Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Professionals must have `role = 'professional'` to access the dashboard
   - Policyholders continue using the existing intake flow
   - Automatic redirection based on user role

2. **Lead Management**
   - Anonymized lead display until purchase
   - Full contact details revealed after payment
   - Lead status tracking (new, claimed, expired)

3. **Payment System**
   - Stripe integration for secure payments
   - Credit system for bulk purchases
   - Transaction tracking and audit trail

4. **Notifications**
   - Email alerts to professionals when new leads are available
   - State-based targeting for relevant professionals
